# Module 3 - Logic Apps

As BFYOC, customer satisfaction is of the utmost importance. Because of this, BFYOC has decided to implement a customer survey system to follow up after purchase to collect feedback.

In this module, you will be using Logic Apps as the workflow engine and integration platform to connect all the pieces together and implement such system. Let's get started.

## Pre-requisites

* A modern laptop running Windows 10, Mac OSX Mac OS X 10.12 or higher
* Your preferred browser to access [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)

## Challenge

Create a Logic App that will be triggered by an incoming custom Event Grid topic event. 

```json
{
  "orderId": "1",
  "itemOrdered": "52325",
  "email": "hello@contoso.com"
}
```

Upon receiving the event, the Logic App will query Cosmos DB to retrieve the product information, using the Cosmos Db connector. Once the product information is retrieved, make the Logic App to into sleep for 5 minutes to simulate a delay before the follow up. Then, send an e-mail with different options (`Very satisfied`, `Satisfied`, `Neutral`, `Unsatisfied`, `Very unsatisfied`) so users can response. Then, you will be able to take customer's response and take appropriate actions.

Capture user's respond and store it in another table in Cosmos DB.

### Tips

1. Search for `Cosmos Db` and add `Get a document` action, you will first need to create a connection to it.
1. Select `icecream` as **Database ID**, `products` as **Collection ID**, and select `itemOrdered` token as input to **DocumentId**.
1. Next, add a new action from either Outlook 365 or Outlook.com, depending on the type of account you have. The name of the action is **Send email with options**.
1. Add another `Parse JSON` action, this time, use the `Body` output from `Get a document` action as input to **Content**, and use the following sample to generate schema.
```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "flavor": "Rainbow Road",
  "price-per-scoop": 3.99
}
```
1. Use `email` token as input for **To**, `BFYOC values your feedback` as **Subject**, and `Very satisfied, Satisfied, Neutral, Unsatisfied, Very unsatisfied` for **User Options**. Then, use various tokens available to write a nice e-mail body.
