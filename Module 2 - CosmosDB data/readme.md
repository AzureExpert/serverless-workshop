# Module 2 - CosmosDB data

This module will focus on bringing your simple serverless API from module 1 and putting some real data behind it to power it.  The challenge will be to make it so the id property does an actual lookup in a CosmosDB database to return product information.  In addition you could expose an additional API to `POST` and create new products.
